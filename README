OVERVIEW

This archive contains S-Plus translations of all the SAS and MATLAB
code that is used in David Ruppert's text, "Statistics and Finance: an
Introduction" (Springer-Verlag, 2004).  It is provided as a convenience
to students using the text.

ORGANIZATION

There is a directory named "chapterXX" for each chapter. Each such
directory contains all the code needed to replicate the figures and
examples in that chapter. Each code file (with extension ".q") is
named according to whether it generates a figure (e.g., "figure4-1.q"
generates Figure 4.1) or replicates an example (e.g., "page410.q"
contains a translation of the code on or around page 410). In addition,
each directory also contains a ".First.q" file. This file loads any
auxiliary functions needed for that chapter, and should be run before
running any of the code for that chapter.

Chapters 1 and 14 do not contain code or figures, hence they do not
have directories.

The directory "common" contains auxiliary functions used throughout the
book. It also contains a subdirectory, "data" that contains all the data
sets for the book. Most of these data sets come from Ruppert's web site,
but I managed to track down a few data sets that Ruppert did not provide
(e.g., the Pindyck and Rubinfeld data set used in Chapter 12).

STYLE

I have written this code with the student in mind. I have tried to use
basic S-Plus commands wherever possible; for example, I have avoided
using the more efficient "apply" commands in favor of more straightforward
"for" loops. I have also tried to explain the trickier parts of the code
in my comments. Hopefully everything is fairly clear.

S-Plus, MATLAB, and SAS are all very different computational
packages. I've taken great pains to make S-Plus figures look like MATLAB
figures. In a few places I've provided code that replicates SAS's output
exactly for illustrative purposes, while in other places I simply showed
how to calculate the statistics needed and nothing more.

STANDARD WARRANTIES, DISCLAIMERS, LEGALESE, ETC.

All of the code was developed on a Pentium IV machine running Windows
XP SP2 with S-Plus 6.2.  I have not verified that the code works as
described under any other architecture, operating system, or version of
S-Plus (or R). I provide this code without any warranties or guarantees.
By using this code you agree not to hold me responsible for any damage
to your computer this code may cause.
