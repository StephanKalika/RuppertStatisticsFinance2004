It is provided as a convenience\r\nto students using the text.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nThere is a directory named \"chapterXX\" for each chapter. Each such\r\ndirectory contains all the code needed to replicate the figures and\r\nexamples in that chapter. Each code file (with extension \".q\") is\r\nnamed according to whether it generates a figure (e.g., \"figure4-1.q\"\r\ngenerates Figure 4.1) or replicates an example (e.g., \"page410.q\"\r\ncontains a translation of the code on or around page 410). In addition,\r\neach directory also contains a \".First.q\" file. This file loads any\r\nauxiliary functions needed for that chapter, and should be run before\r\nrunning any of the code for that chapter.\r\n\r\nChapters 1 and 14 do not contain code or figures, hence they do not\r\nhave directories.\r\n\r\nThe directory \"common\" contains auxiliary functions used throughout the\r\nbook. It also contains a subdirectory, \"data\" that contains all the data\r\nsets for the book. Most of these data sets come from Ruppert's web site,\r\nbut I managed to track down a few data sets that Ruppert did not provide\r\n(e.g., the Pindyck and Rubinfeld data set used in Chapter 12).\r\n\r\nSTYLE\r\n\r\nI have written this code with the student in mind. I have tried to use\r\nbasic S-Plus commands wherever possible; for example, I have avoided\r\nusing the more efficient \"apply\" commands in favor of more straightforward\r\n\"for\" loops. I have also tried to explain the trickier parts of the code\r\nin my comments. Hopefully everything is fairly clear.\r\n\r\nS-Plus, MATLAB, and SAS are all very different computational\r\npackages. I've taken great pains to make S-Plus figures look like MATLAB\r\nfigures. In a few places I've provided code that replicates SAS's output\r\nexactly for illustrative purposes, while in other places I simply showed\r\nhow to calculate the statistics needed and nothing more.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD WARRANTIES, DISCLAIMERS, LEGALESE, ETC.\r\n\r\nAll of the code was developed on a Pentium IV machine running Windows\r\nXP SP2 with S-Plus 6.2.  I have not verified that the code works as\r\ndescribed under any other architecture, operating system, or version of\r\nS-Plus (or R). I provide this code without any warranties or guarantees.\r\nBy using this code you agree not to hold me responsible for any damage\r\nto your computer this code may cause.\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n\r\nTBD.\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS, SUGGESTIONS, QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nSend any comments, suggestions, or questions you may have to me (cggreen\r\nAT stat DOT washington DOT edu).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
